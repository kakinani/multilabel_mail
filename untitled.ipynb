cap third the order close the ridicul broker loophol that made the ferc previous price cap swiss chees befor generat could redirect their sale from the market to energi broker who were exempt from the pric e cap so where did the ferc go wrong the problem may be trace to the two compet method of impos price cap and the all import concept of econom rent econom rent in the wholesal electr market is the market pric e of electr minus the produc cost where cost includ not just labo r and fuel but a fair profit on the invest capit as well in traditiona l regul this fair profit is calcul veri simpli as the market cost o f the money borrow to build the power plant under this definit if the produc cost is a nickel a kilowatt hour and he can sell it for cent as produc in the west have been do the produc can extract cent of econom rent from consum in california the extract of such econom rent through market manipul has taken place on a grand theft scale in california electr bill was about billion last year it was almost billion for rough the same amount of electr this year california bill is well on it way to billion annual to stop this rip off gov gray davi propos cost base price cap such cap are calcul on a plant specif basi each generat is allow ed to recov it cost of product includ the fair profit but not a pen ny more thus for exampl a newer high effici plant generat power at a nickel per kilowatt hour would collect a nickel the oldest least efficien t plant that generat power for cent would be allow to collect cent s by set differ price for differ plant the econom rent a re driven to zero yet each generat still has a fair profit incent to produc from a public polici perspect it the best of all possibl world and it was categor reject by the ferc instead the ferc se ts a singl price for all generat base on the cost of the least effici plant the obvious problem with this umbrella price rule is that it still allow generat to extract billion in econom rent from consum in our previous exampl and under the ferc rule the least efficien t plant still collect cent a unit to recov cost howev the most effici plant produc power at a nickel per kilowatt also collect cent rather than a nickel and thus extract a full cent of econom rent thus under the ferc rule wholesal generat still will be abl t o captur ten of billion of dollar more from consum and busi than under davi cost base rule the ferc approach is still subject to the same kind of strateg game that has been the hallmark of this crisi generat will ensur th at dure peak time when the price cap is be establish the most expens possibl plant is in oper whether it need to be or not th is will peg the price at the highest level in addit the ferc provid generat with a pervers incent to run their least effici unit more often sinc these least effici plant are also the highest pollut the result will be dirtier air moreov the excess run of these plant may also put a strain on alreadi stretch natur gas suppli these least effici plant use up to more natur gas to produc a unit of electr the bottom line the ferc done good but it could have done a lot better and the way thing stand now there still is a
